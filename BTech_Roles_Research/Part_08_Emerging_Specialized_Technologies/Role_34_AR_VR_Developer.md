## Final Verdict

**AR/VR Development: Creative, Growing, Portfolio-Driven Career**

**Pros:**
- Creative and technical work (satisfying)
- Cutting-edge technology (VR, metaverse)
- Growing market in India (gaming, e-commerce AR)
- Visual, immediate results
- Diverse applications (gaming, education, enterprise)
- Remote international opportunities
- Can freelance (AR/VR projects pay well)
- Passionate community

**Cons:**
- Smaller job market than web/mobile dev
- Portfolio mandatory (can't skip, takes time)
- Need creative + technical skills (not just coding)
- Gaming salaries often lower than enterprise tech
- VR headset investment needed for full VR learning (₹25k-35k)
- Rapid technology changes (new SDKs, platforms)
- Some roles require 3D artist collaboration

**Bottom Line:**
AR/VR development is an excellent career for those passionate about gaming, 3D graphics, and immersive experiences. The Indian market is growing, especially in mobile AR (e-commerce, social filters) and gaming. Unity is the primary skill in demand.

**Best approach:** Focus on Unity + ARCore (mobile AR) initially since it requires no VR headset and has more job opportunities. Build a strong portfolio with 4-5 published/deployed projects. Keep general programming skills sharp as backup. Specialize in a domain (gaming, e-commerce AR, or enterprise VR).

**Recommended for:** Creative problem-solvers who love gaming/3D, are willing to build impressive portfolios, have good spatial reasoning, enjoy both coding and visual design, and are excited about the future of XR/metaverse.

**Not recommended for:** Pure backend enthusiasts, those wanting maximum job market size, people uncomfortable with creative work, those who can't invest time in portfolio building, or those seeking highest salaries (AI/ML pays more).
