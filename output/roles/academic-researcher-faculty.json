During PhD, you learn not just research but also teaching, grant writing, and academic norms. Even after getting a faculty position, it takes 2-3 years to establish your lab, develop courses, and find your groove. The learning curve continues throughout your career as you mentor students, write grants, and navigate academic politics. Only pursue if you have genuine passion for research and teaching."
