Need to learn C/C++ thoroughly, understand electronics fundamentals, work with actual hardware, and grasp low-level concepts like memory maps, interrupts, and peripheral registers. The challenge is the intersection of hardware and software - you need to read datasheets, use oscilloscopes, understand circuit diagrams, and debug issues that could be in hardware or software. However, once you understand the fundamentals, the concepts remain consistent across different platforms."
