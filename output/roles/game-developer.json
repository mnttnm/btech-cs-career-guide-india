    "description": "**Steep** - Becoming job-ready takes 12-18 months of dedicated learning and portfolio building. Game development combines programming, mathematics, physics, and understanding of player psychology. You need to master a game engine (Unity or Unreal), learn C# or C++, understand game design principles, and build a portfolio of playable games. The challenge is that game development is highly competitive and passion-driven - employers expect to see shipped games or strong portfolio projects. Unlike web development, you can't just learn syntax; you need to understand complex systems like physics engines, animation controllers, AI, and optimization for different platforms. However, the field is incredibly rewarding for those passionate about games."
