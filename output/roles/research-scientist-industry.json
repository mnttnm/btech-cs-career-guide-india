The PhD itself is a journey of learning research methodology, critical thinking, and deep specialization. Even after PhD, it takes 2-3 years to become an independent researcher. The challenge is not just technical skills but also scientific thinking, paper writing, and handling the uncertainty of research (most experiments fail). Only pursue if you have genuine passion for pushing boundaries of knowledge."
