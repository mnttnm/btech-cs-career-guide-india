Even experienced engineers find 80% of startup work unfamiliar. You're constantly in over your head, figuring things out on the fly. The learning never stops. What you don't know can kill your startup (bad unit economics, legal mistakes, wrong market). Most founders spend 2-3 years learning through failures before finding success. Only pursue if you love learning through painful trial and error."
