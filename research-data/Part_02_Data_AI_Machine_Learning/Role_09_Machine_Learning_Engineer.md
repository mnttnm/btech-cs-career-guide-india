- System design for ML is complex: scalability, latency, resource management
- Rapidly evolving tools and frameworks
- Production debugging is harder than research experimentation
- Need to balance model accuracy with engineering constraints (latency, cost, memory)

### Time to Productivity:
- **3-6 months:** Basic model deployment, simple pipelines with guidance
- **6-12 months:** Independent feature development, moderate complexity projects
- **1-2 years:** End-to-end ML system ownership, production debugging proficiency
- **3+ years:** System design, architectural decisions, mentoring others

### Easier If You Have:
- Strong software engineering background (better than pure statistics background)
- Prior experience with distributed systems
- Solid understanding of ML fundamentals
- Internship experience in ML engineering roles
- Contributions to ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)

### Harder Than Traditional Software Engineering Because:

- **Resource constraints:** Balancing model accuracy with GPU/compute costs
- **Scalability challenges:** Making models work for millions of users is hard
- **Evolving requirements:** Product changes require model retraining, pipeline updates
- **Cross-functional pressure:** Coordinating with data scientists, backend engineers, product managers
- **Tight deadlines:** Experiments need to be productionized quickly

### Mitigating Factors:
- High intellectual stimulation and challenging problems
- Cutting-edge technology work
- Strong compensation packages
- Flexible work arrangements (remote/hybrid common)
- Prestigious role with high market value
- Collaborative team environments in good companies

### Stress Varies By:
- **Company stage:** Startups (higher stress, faster pace) vs big tech (more resources, better processes)
- **Team maturity:** Established ML teams vs building from scratch
- **Product criticality:** Core features (high stress) vs experimental features (lower)
- **On-call frequency:** Varies significantly by company
