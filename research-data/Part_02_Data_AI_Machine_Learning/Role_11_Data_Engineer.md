- Clear success criteria (data flows correctly or it doesn't)
- Strong job market and compensation
- Remote-friendly work culture
- Good work-life balance in many product companies
- Collaborative team environments
- Intellectually engaging work

### Stress Varies By:
- **Company stage:** Startups (higher stress, less infrastructure) vs established companies (mature systems)
- **Team size:** Solo DE (high stress) vs large team (distributed load)
- **Data maturity:** Greenfield (build from scratch) vs mature platform
- **Industry:** Finance/healthcare (strict SLAs) vs others (moderate)

## Key Differentiators: Data Engineer vs Similar Roles

### Data Engineer vs Data Scientist:
- **DE:** Building data infrastructure, pipelines, making data accessible
- **DS:** Analyzing data, building models, generating insights
- **Key difference:** DE enables DS; DE focuses on "how data flows," DS on "what data means"

### Data Engineer vs Data Analyst:
- **DE:** Building pipelines, infrastructure, engineering-heavy, backend focus
- **DA:** Querying data, creating reports, dashboards, SQL + BI tools
- **Career path:** Often DA → DE (analysts learn engineering and transition)

### Data Engineer vs Backend Engineer:
- **DE:** Data pipelines, big data, batch/streaming processing, analytics focus
- **Backend:** Application logic, APIs, microservices, user-facing features
- **Overlap:** Both use similar tools (Python, databases, cloud)
- **DE is specialized backend:** Focus on data workflows

### Data Engineer vs ML Engineer:
- **DE:** Data infrastructure, ETL, making data ready for analysis
- **MLE:** Building ML models, deployment, ML systems
- **Collaboration:** DE provides data to MLE; MLE builds features on top
- **Can transition:** DE → MLE if you learn ML

### Data Engineer vs Analytics Engineer:
- **DE:** Infrastructure, big data, pipelines (Python, Spark, Airflow)
- **Analytics Engineer:** Transformations, dbt, SQL-heavy, closer to business
- **Analytics Engineer is newer:** Hybrid of DE and DA, focuses on dbt and data warehouse
