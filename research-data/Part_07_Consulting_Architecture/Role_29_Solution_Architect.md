# Role #29: Solution Architect

**Career Level:** 🔴 Senior Role (Requires 5-8+ Years Experience)
**India Market Data:** 2024-2025 Edition

---

## Overview

**What is a Solution Architect?**

A Solution Architect is a senior technical role responsible for designing comprehensive technology solutions to solve specific business problems. Unlike developers who implement code, Solution Architects create the blueprint for how systems should be built, ensuring they meet technical requirements, business goals, and can scale effectively.

**IMPORTANT:** This is NOT an entry-level role. You cannot become a Solution Architect directly after B.Tech. The typical path requires 5-8 years of hands-on development experience before transitioning to this role.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Developer:** Writes code to implement features
- **Tech Lead:** Leads a team of developers, makes technical decisions for projects
- **Solution Architect:** Designs entire systems and solutions, works across multiple teams/projects

## Myths vs Reality

### Myth 1: "Architects don't code anymore"

**Reality:** Good architects code regularly, though less than developers (20-30% of time). They:
- Review critical code
- Build POCs (Proof of Concepts)
- Write reference implementations
- Debug complex production issues

### Myth 2: "You need a master's degree to become an architect"

**Reality:** Not required. Experience matters more than education. However:
- MS can accelerate to 5-6 years instead of 7-8
- Helps with system design and research mindset
- Not a prerequisite in most companies

### Myth 3: "Architects just draw diagrams"

**Reality:** Diagramming is <20% of the job. Most time spent on:
- Requirements gathering and analysis
- Technology evaluation and POCs
- Guiding development teams
- Stakeholder communication
- Troubleshooting and problem-solving

### Myth 4: "Once an architect, always an architect"

**Reality:** Some architects return to individual contributor roles if they miss coding. Others move to:
- Engineering Management
- Product Management
- CTO/VP Engineering
- Independent consulting

### Myth 5: "Service company architects aren't real architects"

**Reality:** Service companies have excellent architects, especially in:
- Enterprise architecture practices
- Domain-specific expertise (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce)
- Client-facing solution design
- May have different challenges than product companies, but equally valuable experience
